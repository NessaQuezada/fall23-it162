       <p>Hi, my name is Vanessa Garcia. I'm an IT161 student. I entered into the IT program to develop skills to be a web designer, I am especially artistic and come from a background in technology as well as taking mulitmedia classes.</p>
       <p>I love working with many diiferent mediums in art from acrylic paint to digital art. Design has been my passion since I was a young child, having taken many art classes throughout my time at school, and having wished as a kid to be an interior designer or an architect. I see web design as another form of art that allows me to be artistic in a functional way.</p>
       <p>My hope is that I can use my dgree in the future to help artists of all kinds building thier web pages for thier careers or their business, and progress my own art career. </p>
